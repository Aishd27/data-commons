# Data Retrieval and Processing Overview

## I. Fetch Scope

To start, you can fetch all zip codes, counties, states, and countries using the provided code snippets. The returned places will include their respective 'dcid' identifiers. Depending on your use case, you may need to reformat these identifiers.

### FIPS Codes Overview

- **State FIPS Codes:** Two-digit codes that uniquely identify each U.S. state and territory.
  - Example: `01` is the FIPS code for Alabama.
  - Example: `06` is the FIPS code for California.

- **County FIPS Codes:** Five-digit codes where:
  - The first two digits represent the state FIPS code.
  - The next three digits represent the county code within that state.
  - Example: `01001` is the FIPS code for Autauga County, Alabama (`01` for Alabama and `001` for Autauga County).

### Identifier Formats for Retrieved Data

- **Zipcodes:** Returned in the format `'zip/02908'`.
- **Counties:** Returned in the format `'geoId/01001'`.
- **States:** Returned in the format `'geoId/01'`.
- **Countries:** Returned in the format `'country/ABW'` (ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code, e.g., `ABW` for Aruba).

### Get Methods

- `get_states()`: Fetches the list of states.
- `get_counties()`: Fetches the list of counties.
- `get_zipcodes()`: Fetches the list of zip codes.
- `get_countries()`: Fetches the list of countries.

## II. Fetch Target 

### Method: `fetch_data_and_process_dpd(places, target_variable_dcid, api_key)`

In this section, we will retrieve target variables using the `datacommons_pandas` package. This approach is organized and straightforward, as we have all the necessary DCIDs for the places within our specified scope. Depending on specific requirements, additional steps may be needed to clean and transform the DataFrame.

The resulting DataFrame will include the following columns:

- **PlaceDCID**
- **PlaceName**
- **Target** (0/1): This column contains the classified value.
- **Variable_DCID**: For instance, 'Count_Person', which contains the raw value.

To meet different needs, you can easily create a new DataFrame with only the desired columns. The target variable is classified as follows:

- **0** for values below the top 20%
- **1** for values in the top 20%

## III. Zipcode Data Level for ML

To ensure compliance of the DataFrame for machine learning applications, an additional step is required: convert the target variable in the second column into a *binary classification* based on a defined threshold, while retaining the first column as Zipcode.

## IV. Appendix

Fetch zip-code data using the REST v2 API. This method is now deprecated and is included for reference only.

**Important Note:** Always start by fetching the places within your specified scope, and then use the relevant fetch methods to obtain the corresponding data.
